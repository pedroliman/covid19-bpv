This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
d <- read.csv("INTERMEDIATE/mu.solutions.2groups.final.csv")
d <- d[!is.na(d$tau),]
unique.cases <- unique(d$case.id)
aux <- subset(d,delta==0)
table(aux$case.id)
aux2 <- subset(aux,case.id==117)
plot(aux2$tau,aux2$nu2)
plot(aux2$tau,aux2$rho12)
plot(aux2$tau,aux2$rho21)
plot(aux2$tau,aux2$rho22)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
